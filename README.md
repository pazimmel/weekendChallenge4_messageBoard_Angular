# weekendChallenge4_messageBoard_Angular

In this project, I took my message board repo,
(https://github.com/pazimmel/weekendChallenge4_messageBoard),
and converted all of the jQuery into angular, while attempting to keep
all of the same functionality for the app. This is my first project 
using angular.
